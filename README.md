A modelling experiment that may or may not be useful. This repository contains common ingredients, recipes, a way to map them together, and meta data for preparation.

## Potential Uses
Once common recipes are mapped, can potentially:

- generate a shopping list from a quick selection
- warn about expiration date clashes in shopping list
- hook list into grocery delivery APIs
- run time optimization algorithms for multiple recipes
